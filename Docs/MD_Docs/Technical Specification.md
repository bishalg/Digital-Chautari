## **A Framework for Decentralized Voice Collection and End-to-End Verifiable Voting**

Version: 1.0  
Status: For Technical Review

### **Abstract**

This report introduces the Digital Chautari Protocol (DCP), a comprehensive framework for creating a decentralized, federated system for public voice data collection and cryptographically secure voting. The protocol is designed to address the critical need for trustworthy, transparent, and user-centric digital public infrastructure. DCP's architecture is modeled on the robust and scalable design of the Authenticated Transfer Protocol (AT Protocol), comprising three core components: Personal Voice Servers (PVS) that act as sovereign data repositories for users; Aggregation Relays that create a public, verifiable data firehose; and Application Views (AVs) that provide services like vote tallying. This architectural separation of data ownership from application logic is a foundational element of the protocol's security and flexibility.

To ensure the principle of "one person, one vote" and provide strong resistance to Sybil attacks, DCP integrates a sophisticated identity layer based on World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). Eligibility is managed by trusted issuers who provide cryptographic attestations to users, who can then prove their right to vote in a privacy-preserving manner using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs). This approach decouples voter identity from the cast ballot, ensuring robust anonymity.

The voting application itself is built upon decades of academic research in electronic voting, implementing an end-to-end verifiable (E2E-V) system. By employing cryptographic primitives such as homomorphic encryption, the protocol allows for the public tallying of encrypted votes without ever decrypting an individual ballot, thus guaranteeing ballot secrecy. The E2E-V properties ensure that any participant can independently verify that their vote was cast as intended, recorded as cast, and counted as recorded, providing mathematical proof of the election's integrity. All data structures and interactions are standardized within an open, extensible "Digital Chautari Lexicon," ensuring interoperability across the ecosystem. This document provides a detailed specification of the protocol's architecture, identity and data layers, cryptographic mechanisms, and security model.

### **1\. Architectural Framework: Principles of a Decentralized Public Voice Network**

The foundational architecture of the Digital Chautari Protocol (DCP) is engineered to establish a resilient, interoperable, and scalable network that fundamentally separates user data control from application-level services. This design is a deliberate synthesis of principles proven effective in modern decentralized systems, most notably the AT Protocol. The primary objective is to create a public infrastructure that avoids the pitfalls of centralized platforms—namely, single points of failure, censorship, and the erosion of user data sovereignty.

#### **1.1. Core Philosophy: Federation, Portability, and Algorithmic Choice**

* **Federation:** DCP is architected as a federated network, meaning its core services can be operated by anyone. This eliminates single points of control and failure, enhancing censorship resistance and overall network resilience.  
* **Account Portability:** A cornerstone of user sovereignty is the ability to move freely between service providers without data loss or lock-in. DCP guarantees account portability, ensuring that a user can migrate their entire account—identity, data, and social graph—to a new provider without requiring permission.  
* **Algorithmic Choice:** DCP is designed to foster a marketplace of applications, not to prescribe a single way of interacting with data. The architecture explicitly supports "algorithmic choice," allowing users to select which services process and interpret their public data.

#### **1.2. Key Architectural Components**

* **Personal Voice Server (PVS):** The PVS is the heart of a user's presence on the network, functioning as their sovereign agent and data store. It hosts their signed data repository, manages their identity (DID), and orchestrates network interactions.  
* **Aggregation Relays:** These are the "big-world" networking components. A Relay's primary function is to crawl the network of PVSs and aggregate their public data into a single, comprehensive "firehose," which serves as the system's public bulletin board.  
* **Application Views (AVs):** An AV is a service that consumes the data firehose and performs application-specific indexing and processing. For DCP, the most critical AV is the **Tallying Service**, which performs the homomorphic tallying of encrypted ballots.  
* **The Digital Chautari Lexicon:** To ensure seamless interoperability, DCP utilizes a global schema framework called the Digital Chautari Lexicon. This is a collection of schema definitions (e.g., in JSON Schema) that specify the structure of every data record and network API call.

### **2\. The Identity Layer: Sybil-Resistant Eligibility via Verifiable Credentials**

To ensure "one person, one vote," DCP addresses the Sybil attack problem by creating a robust identity layer based on W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs).

* **Foundation: W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs):** The root of every user's identity is a DID, a globally unique identifier controlled by the user, independent of any centralized registry.  
* **Eligibility: The Verifiable Credential (VC) Model:** DCP employs the VC data model, establishing a trust triangle between an **Issuer** (e.g., a government body verifying a National ID), a **Holder** (the citizen), and a **Verifier** (the DCP Tallying Service). The Issuer provides a digitally signed VoterEligibilityCredential to the citizen.  
* **Privacy-Preserving Proof:** When voting, the user's privacy is protected using a **Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)**. The ZKP allows the user to prove they hold a valid credential and have not already voted, without revealing any information that could link them to their ballot. This cryptographically severs the link between the voter's identity and their ballot.

### **3\. The Data Layer: Secure and Interoperable Voice Collection**

The protocol's data layer is designed with security, privacy, and interoperability as its foremost priorities, treating voice recordings as valuable personal data under the user's exclusive control.

* **Standardizing Voice Capture:** DCP establishes technical recommendations for voice collection (e.g., 16 kHz sample rate, 16-bit depth) and recommends a standardized "Voice Record Envelope" for interoperability.  
* **Privacy by Design:** The handling of voice data is strictly governed by principles of Data Minimization, Purpose Limitation, and User Control, in line with global standards like the EDPB guidelines.  
* **Decoupling Voice from Voting:** A crucial architectural choice is the complete separation of the raw voice data from the public voting process. The encrypted VoiceRecord is stored privately on the user's PVS. The client application processes this locally to create an EncryptedBallot, which contains no voice data and is the only object published to the public network.

### **4\. The Application Layer: An End-to-End Verifiable Voting Protocol**

The DCP application layer implements a state-of-the-art electronic voting protocol designed to be secure, private, and fully auditable by any participant. This property is known as **end-to-end verifiability (E2E-V)**.

#### **4.1. The Ballot Lifecycle**

1. **Creation and Encryption:** A user's choice is converted into a digital ballot and encrypted on their device using a homomorphic encryption scheme (e.g., ElGamal).  
2. **Casting:** The encrypted ballot and the ZKP of eligibility are packaged into a signed CastVoteTransaction and posted to the public bulletin board (the Relay firehose).  
3. **Tallying:** The Tallying Service verifies the ZKP for each ballot and then homomorphically combines all the encrypted ballots into a single encrypted tally.  
4. **Decryption:** Election trustees collectively decrypt the final aggregate tally. At no point is any individual ballot ever decrypted.

#### **4.2. End-to-End Verifiability (E2E-V) Guarantees**

* **1\. Cast-as-Intended:** Voters can "challenge" a ballot before it's cast to verify that their choice was encrypted correctly.  
* **2\. Recorded-as-Cast:** Voters receive a unique tracking code to verify that their encrypted ballot was successfully received and included in the public record.  
* **3\. Counted-as-Recorded (Universal Verifiability):** Any independent third party can download the public election data and mathematically verify that the final tally is the correct sum of all valid ballots.

### **5\. Data Schemas and Standardization**

All DCP data schemas and network APIs are formally defined within the **Digital Chautari Lexicon** using a language-agnostic format like JSON Schema. This ensures interoperability and enables independent auditing. Key schemas include:

* VoterEligibilityCredential  
* EncryptedBallot  
* CastVoteTransaction  
* ElectionDefinition  
* ElectionResultReport

### **6\. Security Analysis and Threat Modeling**

The protocol's security is analyzed against a range of threats, including malicious voters, compromised clients, malicious infrastructure operators, and network adversaries.

| Threat | Mitigation Mechanism in DCP |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Ballot Tampering** | Digital signatures on all records; E2E-V allows public verification. |
| **Ballot Stuffing** | ZKP of eligibility required to cast a vote. |
| **Double Voting** | Unique, anonymous nullifier hash prevents duplicate votes. |
| **Breaking Ballot Secrecy** | Homomorphic encryption for tallying; ZKP decouples identity from the ballot. |
| **Sybil Attack** | Eligibility is tied to Verifiable Credentials issued by trusted entities. |
| **Coercion / Vote Buying** | Partial mitigation via ballot challenge and support for re-voting. |
| **Denial of Service** | Federated architecture provides natural resilience. |

### **7\. Protocol Governance and Ecosystem Development**

Long-term viability depends on a healthy ecosystem and transparent governance.

* **Open Source Licensing:** The reference implementation will be licensed under the **Apache License 2.0** to provide legal clarity and an explicit patent grant, encouraging both community and commercial adoption.  
* **Governance Model:** A decentralized, meritocratic governance model, inspired by The Apache Software Foundation, will be established for making decisions about the protocol's evolution, particularly changes to the Vox Lexicon.  
* **Funding and Sustainability:** A **"Digital Chautari Commons Fund,"** fiscally hosted by a neutral non-profit, will be created to support open-source development, infrastructure, and community initiatives through grants and donations.

### **8\. Conclusion and Future Work**

The Digital Chautari Protocol provides a practical, secure, and verifiable blueprint for the next generation of digital democratic tools. Future research will focus on areas such as post-quantum cryptography, more decentralized proof-of-personhood mechanisms, and extensive usability research to ensure the system is accessible and trustworthy for all citizens.
